Here you find more details about what we offer.

Let's see what each section describes.

1. [Systems](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/e930b7b667ceaf66c2fab86a76044d0260b934fa/docs/fundamentals/systems/core/overview.md) <br>
   These are the fundamental systems that power all of our components.
2. [Tools](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/e930b7b667ceaf66c2fab86a76044d0260b934fa/docs/fundamentals/tools/helpers/overview.md) <br>
   Frontend Tools useful for web development but are not visual and therefore are not components.
3. [Node Tools](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/e930b7b667ceaf66c2fab86a76044d0260b934fa/docs/fundamentals/node-tools/babel-plugin-extend-docs/overview.md) <br>
   Node tools to analyse the code and for extending the documentation.
4. [Rationales](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/e930b7b667ceaf66c2fab86a76044d0260b934fa/docs/fundamentals/rationales/side-effects.md) <br>
   The reasoning behind some of our decisions.
